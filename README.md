Formal proof of correctness of long division algorithm as appearing in PLCC Chapter 2, modelled within an Imp variant

## Spoiler Alert

In the end of Chapter 2 of [Program Logics for Certified Compilers (PLCC)](https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/download/PLCC-to-chapter-3.pdf), the reader is advised to work through the steps of the proof involving the correctness of the long division algorithm shown here (or consult a detailed proof referenced by the book). You are advised not to peek at the contents of this repo until you have at least made an attempt at proving it yourself, though it is not mandatory to do so.

## Credits

The long division algorithm is taken from a [free excerpt of PLCC](https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/download/PLCC-to-chapter-3.pdf) while the toy programming language used in this repo is a variant of the Imp programming language which has its origins in [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu), an excellent resource for learning Coq.
